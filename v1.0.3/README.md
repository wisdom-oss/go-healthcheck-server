## About
This package provides a healthcheck server and client which utilize UNIX sockets
on UNIX-like operating systems and named pipes on Windows operating systems.
The server opens up a socket or a named pipe and waits for a message indicating
that a healthcheck should be executed.
The socket or pipe is randomly named, and the name is added to the environment
variables as `HEALTHCHECK_SOCKET`.
This value is then picked up by the client which allows a seamless integration
into already existing software.

## Specifying a healthcheck function
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since the healthcheck function is executed in a goroutine, you need to check
> your code if running the concurrently is possible. 
> If not, please use a `sync.Mutex` to protect your code and healthcheck 
> function against race conditions. 
> To check for race conditions, you may run your code with the following 
> command:
> ```bash
> go run -race .
> ```

Since there is no possibility to create a single healthcheck function which fits
all use cases, the server awaits a healthcheck function returning an error which
uses the following function signature:
```go
func healthcheckFunction() (err error) {
	// TODO: place your healthcheck functions here
}
```

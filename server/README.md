## About
This package supplies the healthcheck server from the `github.com/wisdom-oss/go-healthcheck`
package.
On Linux operating systems, the server uses the `unix` network and sockets to
achieve inter-process communication with the client.
Since the `unix` network and sockets are not available under Windows, the server
uses [named pipes] from the Windows IPC API using the `go-winio` module.

[named pipes]: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipes

## Configuring
### Socket Name/Pipe Name
The socket name is generated automatically at during the initialization
process. It then is written into the `.hc-socket` file in the working directory
which allows the [client](../client/README.md) to automatically pick up the
socket and connect to it.

### Healthcheck Function
Since the server is not equipped with a default healthcheck function you need to
supply your own function.
This is done to allow a high degree of customization since not every 
microservice or other software product requires the same healthcheck.
The function you need to provide uses the following function signature:
```go
func healthcheck() error {
	// TODO: Implement healthcheck
}
```
The function should return an error if something is not working correctly to
indicate the failure of the healthcheck.
The error message is built by calling `Error()` on the returned object and sent
back using the socket to the client.
